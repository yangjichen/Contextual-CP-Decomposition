# Contextual-CP-Decomposition
We propose a new decomposition framework called Contextual CP decomposition (CCP) model, which incorporate the additional information to estimate the underlying structures that are more accurate and more interpretable. Here we mainly present code logic and data acquisition methods.

### Simulation and Real Dataset Study

1. The simulation experiment is divided into 6 parts, and the data generation method is also reserved.
2. The data used in the GDELT experiment is too large, so we only kept the code for data acquisition and collation. Divided into five stages to achieve our experiment.


### Our paper
Tensor decomposition is among the most important tool for low rank structures extraction in tensor data analysis.
In many scenarios, informative covariates from various domains are available, which can potentially drive the underlying structures of the observed data.
Classical CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) decomposition method only focuses on the relational information among objects, and cannot make use of such additional information.
In this article, we propose a new decomposition framework called Contextual CP decomposition (CCP) model, which incorporate the additional information to estimate the underlying structures that are more accurate and more interpretable.
The framework is closely related to several existing methods and make sense in various situations.
Moreover, we develop an efficient algorithm for parameter estimation. 
We demonstrate the advantages of our proposal with comprehensive simulations and real data analysis on GDELT political events study.
The empirical results show that our method offers improved modeling strategy as well as efficient computation.
